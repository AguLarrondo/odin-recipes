    <h2>Tender, flaky crust surrounding a hearty mixture of warmly-spiced ground beef and vegetables—we’re going to teach you how to make the best beef empanadas you’ve ever tasted.</h2>
    <h3>Pockets of Joy</h3>
    <p>Golden pastry—an easy homemade version that we’ll walk you through—wrapped around a hearty beef filling, these easy empanadas are pure hand-held perfection. They’re one of our favorite party foods, as in we like to make a party out of the process of making empanadas! Are we crazy to think that filling and folding these lovely little pockets is fun? Make the dough ahead of time, and let people assemble their own. Have a beer while they bake, and get ready to dig in! That’s our kind of party.</p>

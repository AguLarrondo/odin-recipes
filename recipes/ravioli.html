    <h2>The St. Louis style of preparing ravioli is unique and delicious. The ravioli is breaded, fried and served with marinara sauce and a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.</h2>   
    <ul>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
            <li>2 tablespoons whole milk</li>
            
            <li>1 egg</li>
            
            <li>¾ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            
            <li>½ teaspoon salt (Optional)</li>
            
            <li>½ (25 ounce) package frozen cheese ravioli, thawed</li>

            <li>3 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>

            <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
            
            <h4>Directions:</h4>

                <li>Combine milk and egg in a small bowl. Place breadcrumbs and if desired, salt in a shallow bowl. Dip ravioli in milk mixture, and coat with breadcrumbs.</li>
                
                <li>In a large saucepan, heat marinara sauce over medium heat until bubbling. Reduce the heat to simmer.</li>    
                
                <li>In a large heavy pan, pour oil to depth of 2 inches. Heat oil over medium heat until a small amount of breading sizzles and turns brown. Fry ravioli, a few at a time, 1 minute on each side or until golden. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve immediately with hot marinara sauce.</li>
